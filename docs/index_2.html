					<h3>What if links are clicked just because they appear on the top?</h3>

				<p>
					On the previous page, we introduced a few factors that can be used to characterise the importance of a page. Now we propose a new, simpler factor:
					<br><br>
					<strong>What if Wikispeedia players just click the first link they see?</strong>

					<h2>Link Position</h2>
					<p>
						Now let's analyse the data to see if players are indeed influenced by the position of the link on the page in Wikispeedia games. Let us compare it against the link which is along to the shortest path to the destination.
					</p>
					<embed src="plots/relative_position/relative_position_sp.png" width="100%" height="100%">
					<p>
						This graph shows the position on the page of links. The distribution of the link that leads to the shortest is roughly uniform, but the distribution of the links that the players actually clicked on is heavily biased towards the top of the page.
					</p>

					<h3>So we're done! ... right?</h3>
					<p>
						We need to carefully choose a <strong>control group</strong> in order to isolate the effect of link position. Luckily, we do have a predictor for semantic similarity: <strong>Graph embeddings</strong>! Given a page and a target destination, we can use <strong>cosine similarity</strong> to calculate the page that is closest to the target destination in the embedding space. This gives us our control group.

					<p>
						There are confounding factors that can affect the probability of a player clicking a link, and we need to account for them in order to isolate the effect of link position. In the previous page, we identified <strong>Pagerank</strong> and <strong>Category</strong> as two factors that greatly affect the link structure of Wikispeedia.
						<br><br>
						We can attenuate their effects by calculating a <strong>propensity score</strong> for each page, which is the probability that a a player will click on the page given the values of the confounding factors. Afterwards, we can match each link clicked to the link in the control group with the closest propensity score. This greatly increases the power of our statistical analysis.

					<h2>Let's put it to the test!</h2>
					<embed src="plots/relative_position/relative_position_density_matched.png" width = 100% height = 100%>
					<p>
						Even after controlling for all the controlled variables, we still see a significant difference in the probability of a player clicking a link based on its position on the page. This is a strong indication that players are indeed influenced by the position of the link on the page.
