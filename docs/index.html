						<h2>What Is Wikispeedia?</h2>
					</header>
					<p><a href="https://wikipedia.org/"><strong>Wikipedia</strong></a> is a beast. A beast which is also many people’s best friend. 
						Haven’t we all been in a situation 
						where we just had to know the name of Napoleon's mother? And her dogs? In this case, the link structure 
						of <strong>Wikipedia</strong> can be quite helpful. Going into the page of Napoleon you might very well find the name of 
						his mother, and a link to the Wikipedia page of her life where you find her dog’s name. This is the 
						logic which should determine the link structure of <strong>Wikipedia</strong>. On each page, links should be available 
						to other pages which are related to the first page.

					<h2>Wikispeedia</h2>
				</header>
				<p>This intuition is what the game <a href="https://dlab.epfl.ch/wikispeedia/play/"><strong>Wikispeedia</strong></a> builds on. 
					The game challenges the user to go from page A to page B 
					only by using the links of the respective pages. Stanford University collected data on ~76000 of these games, 
					recording users' navigation through a subset consisting of ~4600 pages of Wikipedia 2009. This allows us to study 
					how the subset is connected and how users chose to navigate these paths. 
					<br><br>
					What do the paths that you take look like? How do they differ from the shortest path between the two articles?

					<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
					<p>Collaborative authorship is the key aspect to what has allowed <strong>Wikipedia</strong> to grow into the beast that it is. 
						<strong>Wikipedia</strong> has around 44,8 million registered users who can contribute and as of the 19th December 2022, more than 120 000 users made updates during the preceding 30 days. 
						This results in an evolutionary process of each page, and of each page’s links. 
						Therefore, the structure of the network made up of links and pages will change. <br><br>
						<strong>What does this change look like from 2009 to 2022?</strong></p>

								It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to 
								influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark 
								side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, 
								which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He 
								could save others from death, but not himself." alt="" /></a>
