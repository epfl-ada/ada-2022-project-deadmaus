					<h2>Introduction</h2>
				</header>
				<p><a href="https://wikipedia.org/"><strong>Wikipedia</strong></a> is a beast. A beast which is also many people’s best friend. 
					Haven’t we all been in a situation 
					where we just had to know the name of Napoleon's mother? And the <a href = "https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palazzo_Bonaparte_(Roma)">house</a> where she spent her final days? In this case, the link structure 
					of <strong>Wikipedia</strong> can be quite helpful. Going into the page of Napoleon you might very well find the name of 
					his mother, and a link to the Wikipedia page of her life where you find her dog’s name. This is the 
					logic which should determine the link structure of <strong>Wikipedia</strong>. On each page, links should be available 
					to other pages which are related to the first page.

				<p>This intuition is what the game <a href="https://dlab.epfl.ch/wikispeedia/play/"><strong>Wikispeedia</strong></a> builds on. 
					The game challenges the user to go from page A to page B 
					only by using the links of the respective pages. Stanford University collected data on ~76000 of these games, 
					recording users' navigation through a subset consisting of ~4600 pages of <strong>Wikipedia</strong> in 2009. This allows us to study 
					how the subset is connected and how users chose to navigate these paths. 
					<br><br>
					<strong>What do the paths that you take look like? <br> How do they differ from the shortest path between the two articles?</strong>

					<p>Collaborative authorship is the key aspect to what has allowed <strong>Wikipedia</strong> to grow into the beast that it is. 
						<strong>Wikipedia</strong> has around 44,8 million registered users who can contribute and as of the 19th December 2022, more than 120 000 users made updates during the preceding 30 days. 
						This results in an evolutionary process of each page, and of each page’s links. 
						Therefore, the structure of the network made up of links and pages will change. <br><br>
						<strong>What does this change look like from 2009 to 2022?</strong></p>

					<h2>Our Dataset</h2>
					<p>"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself."
						<br><br>
						Our dataset is wikipedia scraped from 2009 - 2022 (artticles + links), + wikispeedia (paths + articles + links) .
					</p>

				<div>
					<h3>Categories</h3>
						<p>We can see that Science and Geography dominate the dataset. This might reflect the way the data has been collected, being mainly played by STEM students as the game is distributed via Stanford Snap and EPFL dlab. Something to keep in mind later on in the analysis. </p>

					<h2>Links</h2>
					<p>Next we have a look at the adjacency matrix between categories. In this plot, we observe how often a category is linked by another in the 2009 data set. For example, we can see that the Geography row is lighter than the Music row on the Y axis. This indicates that more articles link to Geography than links to Design which makes sense since there are in general  more articles which can be connected to geographical places than design items. 
						<br><br>
						On the same topic of article adjacency, let's look at the actual article positioning relative to each other in two dimensions. The nodes have been embedded with node2vec and dimensionality reduced to 3 dimensions using UMAP. 
						
					<h3>Degree distribution</h3>
						<p>
							We can see that the degree distribution is very skewed, with a few pages having a very high number of links, and the majority of pages having a very low number of links. This is a very common phenomenon in real world networks, and is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law">power law</a>.

					<h2>Analysis</h2>
					<p>
						Lets actually do something with this data.
					</p>
					<h3>Pagerank</h3>
					<p>
						This graph shows the distribution of page rank scores over the three networks. What is interesting to note is the development of the link structure between 2009 and 2022 when compared to the weighted graph of 2009. We observe that in 2022, the distribution flattens out and articles with a rank in the middle become more frequent while highly ranked pages become less prevalent. At the same time, we see that the Wikispeedia page usage is tilted towards the pages with high page rank score even when comparing with the 2009 graph. This means that wikipedia is becoming more connected over the period. Users however did not use links that link to high rank pages to a larger degree than they used those linking to low rank pages in 2009. Can we find evidence of what pages have been changed? 

					</p>

					<p>
						We can see that the distribution in pagerank changes every year. Let us see how they change across categories.

					<h2>Graph Embeddings</h2>
					<p>Interesting observations are that Geography articles are widely spread over the two diagrams while Science articles seem to be clustered at the top right. Furthermore, the IT articles are tightly clustered.
