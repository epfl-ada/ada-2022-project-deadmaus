					<h2>Introduction</h2>
				</header>
				<p><a href="https://wikipedia.org/"><strong>Wikipedia</strong></a> is a beast. A beast which is also many people’s best friend. 
					Haven’t we all been in a situation where we just had to know the name of Napoleon's mother? And the name of the 
					house where she spent her final days? In this case, the link structure 
					of <strong>Wikipedia</strong> can be quite helpful. Going into the page of Napoleon you might very well find the name of his mother and a 
					link to the page about her life, where you find that she lived at <a href = "https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palazzo_Bonaparte_(Roma)">Palazzo Bonaparte</a> in Roma until she died at 85 years of age.
					<br><br>
					This is the logic which should determine the link structure of <strong>Wikipedia</strong>. On each page, links should be available 
					to other pages which are related to the first page.

				<p>This intuition is what the game <a href="https://dlab.epfl.ch/wikispeedia/play/"><strong>Wikispeedia</strong></a> builds on. 
					The game challenges the user to go from page A to page B 
					only through using the links of the respective pages. Stanford University collected data on ~76000 of these games, 
					recording users' navigation through a subset consisting of ~4600 pages of <strong>Wikipedia</strong> in 2009. This allows us to study 
					how the subset is connected and how users chose to navigate these paths. 
					<br><br>
					<strong>What do the paths that the players took look like? <br> 
						How do these paths differ from the actual link structure of Wikipedia?</strong>

					<p>Collaborative authorship is the key that allowed <strong>Wikipedia</strong> to grow into the beast that it is. 
						<strong>Wikipedia</strong> has around 44,8 million registered users who can contribute. In November 2022, more than 120 000 updated Wikipedia pages. 
						This results in the evolution of each page and its links over time.
						<br><br>

					<h2>Our Dataset</h2>
					<p>
						Our dataset is a combination of two datasets - Wikispedia data from Stanford University and Wikipedia data from the website itself.
						We scraped the network information of Wikipedia from 2010 - 2022 of all existing pages of the Stanford dataset. 
						This resulted in 13 versions of each page which we performed temporal analysis on.
						<br><br>
						On top of the network data, Wikispedia also provided us the paths that players took while playing the game.

					<p>Let's take a first look at the categories of the Wikipedia pages. <i>Science</i> is the most common category, followed by <i>Geography</i>.</p>

					<h3>What does Wikispedia look like?</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
					We embeded the network generated by Wikispedia into a graph, and then projected it down to 3 dimensions.
					The closer the pages appear to each other, the closer they are in semantic space.
					In general, articles of the same category appear close to each other. In particular, if we filter by <i>Science</i>,
					we can see that there are dense clusters in <i>Physics</i> and <i>Chemistry</i>. Additionally notice that under <i>Science</i>, the <i>Bird</i> cluster is much closer to the <i>Dinosaur</i> and  are closer together . In contrast, <i>Geography</i> is more spread out. Wikispedia players apparently find it easier to relate from places to other topics.
				</p>

				<p>
					This relationship is also present across articles. Try selecting <i>Music</i> and <i>IT</i>. Notice that the <i>IT</i> page closest to the largest <i>Music</i> cluster is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster">Napster</a>, a music "sharing" website popular in 2007.
					<br><br>
					<strong>Try playing with the graph and drawing connections between different articles!</strong>

						<h3>Links</h3>
						<p>
							Let's have a look at the adjacency matrix between categories. In this plot, we observe how often a category is linked by another over the years. For example, we can see that the <i>Geography</i> row is lighter than the <i>Music</i> row. This indicates that more pages link to <i>Geography</i> than pages that link to <i>Music</i>. This makes sense since there are more pages which can be connected to geographical places than <i>Music</i>.

						<h3>Degree distribution</h3>
							<p>
								We can see that the degree distribution is very skewed, with a few pages having a very high number of links, and the majority of pages having a very low number of links. This is a very common phenomenon in real world networks, and is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law">power law</a>. <br><br>

					<h2>But what does this mean?</h2>
					<p>
						However, the in-degree and out-degree are not good predictors of how "important" a page is. A set of obscure pages that is well-connected amongst themselves should not increase their importance.
						<br><br>
						This is where <strong>Pagerank</strong> comes in. Pagerank is a metric that is used to measure the centrality of a page in the network. Since our research question involves the development of pages and their incoming and outgoing links, Pagerank is a suitable proxy for how important a page is, and tracking how these Pageranks evolve over time can give us insight into how the network is changing.
						<br><br>
					</p>
					<embed src="plots/gifs/wikipedia_page_rank_kde.gif" width = 100% height = 100%>
					<p>
						The distribution of Pageranks becomes more evenly distributed over time. This means that the pages with very low Pagerank are being developed and becoming more well-linked.
						<br><br>
						Let us see how the Pagerank changes across categories.
