					<h2>Wikipedia</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					<a href="https://wikipedia.org/"><strong>Wikipedia</strong></a> is a beast. But it is also your best friend.
					Havenâ€™t we all gone down the Wikipedia rabbit hole where you start the day researching on <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon">Napoleon</a> and end up spending hours reading up on his mother and the
					house where she spent her final days? In this case, the link structure of <strong>Wikipedia</strong> can be quite helpful. Napoleon's Wikipedia page has a link to the page of his mother's life, where you can find that she lived at <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Bonaparte">Palazzo Bonaparte</a> in Roma until she died at 85 years of age.
					<br><br>
					This is the logic which should determine the link structure of <strong>Wikipedia</strong>: On each page, there should be links to related pages.

				<h2>Wikispeedia</h2>
				<p>This intuition is what the game <strong>Wikispeedia</strong> builds on. 
					The game challenges the user to go from page A to page B 
					only through using the links of the respective pages. Many interesting strategies have developed from players, including getting to the page of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">the United States</a> as fast as possible, since it is the most well-connected page.

					<h2>Our Dataset</h2>
					<p>
						Our dataset is a combination of two datasets - <strong>Wikispeedia</strong> data from Stanford University and <strong>Wikipedia</strong> data from the website itself. 
						<br><br>
						Collaborative authorship is the key that allowed Wikipedia to grow into the beast that it is. Wikipedia has around 44,8 million registered users who can contribute. In November 2022, more than 120 000 individuals submitted updates to Wikipedia pages. Of all existing pages of the Stanford dataset, we scraped the network information of Wikipedia each year from 2010 - 2022.
						<br><br>
						On top of the network, Wikispeedia also gave us the paths that players took while playing the game. Stanford University collected data on ~76000 of these games, recording users' navigation through ~4600 Wikipedia pages in 2007.

					<h2>What does our data look like?</h2>
					<p>
						Let's take a first look at the categories of the Wikipedia pages.<br><i>Science</i> is the most common category, followed by <i>Geography</i>.
					</p>
					<embed src="plots/category_distribution.html" width = 750 height = 437>
				</header>
				<header>
					<h3>Great, but what about the pages themselves?</h3>
					<p>
						Next, we embeded the network generated by <strong>Wikispeedia</strong> into a graph, and then projected it down to 3 dimensions. The closer the pages appear to each other, the closer they are in semantic space.
						In general, pages of the same category appear close to each other. In particular, if we filter by <i>Science</i>, we can see that there are dense clusters in <i>Physics</i> and <i>Chemistry</i>. Additionally notice that under <i>Science</i>, the <i>Bird</i> cluster is much closer to the <i>Dinosaur</i> and are closer together. In contrast, <i>Geography</i> is more spread out. Wikispeedia players apparently find it easier to relate from places to other topics.
					<br><br>
					<strong>This relationship is also present across pages.</strong>
					<br><br>
						Try selecting <i>Music</i> and <i>IT</i> in the <strong>Wikipedia</strong> graph. Notice that the <i>IT</i> page closest to the largest <i>Music</i> cluster is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster">Napster</a>, a music "sharing" website popular in 2007.

					<iframe src="plots/projections/umap_2022.html" loading="lazy" width = "850px" height = "850px"></iframe>
					<h3>What are the differences between the Wikispeedia paths and the actual Wikipedia pages? </h3>
					<p>
						Now select <i>Music</i> only in the Wikispeedia paths in all 3 graphs. In Wikipedia, the main <i>Music</i> cluster forms a crescent shape, with classical music concepts like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rite_of_Spring">The Rite of Spring</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_and_Adonis_(Shakespeare_poem)">Venus and Adonis</a> on one end, and modern music like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Maiden">Iron Maiden</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(band)">Queen</a> on the other. In contrast, the classical music and modern music clusters are more distinctly separate from each other in the Wikispeedia paths embeddings. This means that Wikispeedia players find the relationships <strong>within</strong> these clusters much more intuitive than <strong>between</strong> the clusters.

						<h3>Links</h3>
						<p>
							Let's have a look at the adjacency matrix between categories. The categories on the horizontal axis represent the outgoing links, and the categories on the vertical axis represent the incoming links.
							<br><br>
							In this plot, we observe how often a category is linked by another over the years. For example, we can see that the <i>Geography</i> row is lighter than the <i>Music</i> row. This indicates that more pages link to <i>Geography</i> than pages that link to <i>Music</i>. This makes sense since there are more pages which can be connected to geographical places than <i>Music</i>.

						<h3>Degree distribution</h3>
							<p>
								We can see that the degree distribution is very skewed, with a few pages having a very high number of links, and the majority of pages having a very low number of links. This is a very common phenomenon in real world networks, and is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law">power law</a>.
								<br><br>
								However, this distribution is more evenly spread as the years go by. This means that relatively obscure pages are being developed, and pages are being developed by linking to relatively obscure pages.

					<h2>But what does this mean?</h2>
					<p>
						However, the in-degree and out-degree are not good predictors of how "important" a page is. A set of obscure pages that is well-connected amongst themselves should not increase their importance.
						<br><br>
						This is where <strong>Pagerank</strong> comes in. Pagerank is a metric that is used to measure the centrality of a page in the network. Since our research question involves the development of pages and their incoming and outgoing links, Pagerank is a suitable proxy for how important a page is, and tracking how these Pageranks evolve over time can give us insight into how the network is changing.
						<br><br>
					</p>
					<embed src="plots/gifs/wikipedia_page_rank_kde.gif" width = 100% height = 100%>
					<p>
						The distribution of Pageranks becomes more evenly distributed over time. This means that the pages with very low Pagerank are being developed and becoming more well-linked.
						<br><br>
						Let us see how the Pagerank changes across categories. 
					</p>
				</header>
				<header>
					<embed src="plots/gifs/page_rank_ridge.gif" loading = lazy width = 80% height = 80%>
					<p>
						The Pagerank distributions for each distributions are evolving over the years. In addition, the shaded distribution represents the Pagerank distribution of the Wikispeedia graph. The most prominent difference in distributions can be seen in the <i>Countries</i> category. Namely, we see that the Pagerank distribution is quite concentrated twowards high Pagerank values. In other words, the <i>Countries</i> pages are considered to be very central. However, Wikispeedia users seem to disagree on this. Instead, according to them, the centrality measure of the <i>Countries</i> category is a much wider distribution with most pages being less important than the actual Wikipedia graph would suggest.

					<h2>Wikipedia: An Evolving Network</h2>
					<p>
						Now let's take a look at which pages changed the most in terms of links. Each wordcloud represents the top 20 pages with the greatest rank increase in Pagerank. The size of the word is proportional to the increase in Pagerank.

						<h3>Inlinks</h3>
						<p>
							Countries dominate the pages with the most inlinks by far. Something always happens somewhere, so developing a Wikipedia page can easily be done by adding links to <i>Country</i> pages.

						<h3>Outlinks</h3>
						<p>
							The greatest increases in outlinks are seemingly random. This is because the greatest increases in outlinks are from pages that Wikipedia writers decide to develop. This is a testament to how bad inlinks are at predicting the importance of pages.

					<h2>What can we do with this data?</h2>
					<p>
						Now we have a good idea of how the network is changing over time. We have seen the <strong>graph embeddings</strong> give insights on semantic similarity between pages, and that <strong>Category</strong> and <strong>Pagerank</strong> strongly affect the importance of pages. But what does this mean for the development of pages? What factors affect Wikispeedia players clicking a link to a page?
